# IDEAS

- [ ] cued row start/stop (independent of note on) like clips
- [ ] drum/trigger mode; row plays a fixed note/channel
- [ ] cued pattern changes
- [ ] follow actions at the slot (pattern) level
- [ ] follow actions at the individual row level
- [ ] independent row level chance multiplier (all of which are scaled by chance boost)
- [ ] row mutes
- [ ] pitch sequencer; offsets from played note, length independent of trigger length
- [ ] 4 x 4 probablility grid for random follow action
- [ ] random follow action modes (a) continuous, (b) only on change (so it repeats the random cycle)
- [ ] rename model.Row to model.Triggers?
- [ ] per row multiplier on random pitch deviation (to disable/reduce on certain rows like the base now)
